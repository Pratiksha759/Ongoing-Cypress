Prerequisites
Docker installed on your machine.
Cypress ,Typesript,mochoawesome installed
Docker extension added in Vs code
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Build the Docker image:
docker build -t project-name .
3.Run the Docker container:

docker run -d -p 8080:80 project-name .

Access the project in your browser at http://localhost:8080.

Working flow:
-create a DockerFile: a text file that contains all commands, in order, needed to build a given image. -build image -create a docker container -Run the testcases via docker-compose.yml file

GithubActions
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Cypres installation along with Typescript and mochoawesome report
Git installed
In your repository, create the .github/workflows/ directory to store your workflow files.
In the .github/workflows/ directory, create a new file called learn-github-actions.yml and add
add code locally using cypress commands
Push back code to github workflow. as Each workflow is stored as a separate YAML file .workflow will be triggered
view result of test execution along with reports
API Testing:
Cypress is a standalone frontend testing tool, it makes HTTP requests on behalf of the web applications as it is executing. While it might appear that Cypress is making these requests from the browser, it actually uses Node.js as an engine to make the HTTP requests to the API server. It uses Node.js to return the responses received from the server. To make an API request, Cypress automation provides an inbuilt command called cy.request().

API Methods

GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are the four most common HTTP methods used in REST APIs. They correspond to the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on resources.

In our project cypress/e2e/ApiTesing contain test files for API tesing using Reqres

Reqres is a hosted REST API that is designed to simulate real-world application scenarios.

It provides a platform where developers can test various functionalities, such as user authentication systems, by responding to requests like login and register with predefined responses. --Reqres offers features like providing fake data, supporting common HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

Visual Testing:
Visual Testing, also known as Visual regression Testing, validates that the visual appearance of an application matches the expected design.
It is all about checking the application beyond functional aspects. Some of the attributes that are validated as a part of Visual Testing are-
Cypress provides several plugins for visual regression testing, which can help you ensure that your application's UI remains visually consistent across different test runs.
These plugins typically involve configuring the directories where the base snapshots and diff snapshots will be stored and may provide a GUI to help you review and manage the snapshots and diffs.
this repository includes Visual testing in cypress using cypress-visual-regression plugin
Installation: npm install cypress-visual-regression

Configure the visual regression plugin and environment variables in your cypress.config.ts file

cypress/support/e2e.ts:

import { addCompareSnapshotCommand } from 'cypress-visual-regression/dist/command' addCompareSnapshotCommand()

cypress/tsconfig.json { "compilerOptions": { "esModuleInterop": true, "types": [ "cypress", "cypress-visual-regression" ] } }
Run tests :npx cypress run
Working: When running your tests, the visual regression plugin will automatically compare the current snapshot of the UI with the base snapshot and generate a diff image if there are any differences. You can then review the diff images and approve or reject them to update the base snapshots.
Database Testing:
Ensure that data store in database is accurate and consistent

Set up a test Database

Connect to database

Write tests to interct with the database

Run the tests using Cypress test Runner

Setting up Cypress for Database Testing:

Installation installing mysql plugin
Connect database by updating Cypress.config.ts file add credentials under env object in cypress.config.ts file Create custom task to execute mysql query in cypress along with a function to execute mysql queries in cypress test using mysql package and return result as a promise
Database Test Suite includes:
Schema testing
Database tables & column testing
Keys and Indexes Testing
Stored procedures Testing
Triggers Testing
Folder Structure:
*The e2e :Integration folder includes all the test files. The test files may be written as.js,.jsx,.coffee, and.cjsx. Usually the preferred extension is.js, and the test file name format is test-name.spec.js. All the test cases will be here.

*Fixture: Fixtures are used to store test data, which can then be used throughout the tests. Usually, the data is stored in JSON format. This is the folder where all the test data is kept by default (like example.json).

*Screenshots and videos (MP4): these folders get created during the execution of tescases.Cypress records a video for each spec file when running tests during a Cypress run. Videos are not automatically recorded during cypress open. Videos are stored in the videos folder, which is set to cypress/videos by default.

*cypress/downloads: This folder is automatically created when your test downloads any file and stores all the downloaded files.

*Support :This folder contains index.js and commands.js files. This index.js file is run before every single spec file. The support folder is a great place to put reusable behavior, such as custom commands.

*command.ts :use to define custom commands to define specific functionality

*e2e.ts: reference for component testing

*PageObjects:organizing page classes with relevant functions and locators, the Cypress Page Object Model enhances code reusability and maintainability

*node_modules : All the libraries and dependencies required for Cypress test execution

*tsconfig.json: Added later to enable autocompletion

*package.json: It is similar to pom.xml in Java. -dependency management file to specify all the required Cypress dependencies

*package-lock.json: This file is used to lock down the versions of your dependencies so
that your project will always use the same versions. regardless of when you install it.

*cypress.config.ts: a configuration file for you. This file will be cypress.config.js for JavaScript apps or cypress.config.ts for TypeScript apps. This file is used to store any configuration specific to Cypress.
